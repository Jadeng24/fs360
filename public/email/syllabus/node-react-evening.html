			Hi {{name}},<br /><br />

			We received your syllabus request for our Fundamentals Bootcamp beginning July 11th. I'm Kat, an admissions counselor at Velocity. You can download the syllabus <a href="{{link}}">here</a>. The class meets Monday - Friday from 9am toÂ­ 5pm for six weeks.
			<br /><br />
			Are you available for a 10-15 minute call to learn about your background and goals? Let me know if you can speak tomorrow or Monday of next week at 4pm.
			<br /><br />
			Also, if you would like to preview a class, we run evening classes Monday - Thursday from 6pm to 9pm. Depending on the day, these classes cover Node, iOS and React.  You are welcome to sit in a session to get a feel for our teaching style, pace and group dynamic. Thanks and let me know if you have any questions.
			<br /><br />
			All the best,
			<br /><br />
			Katrina
