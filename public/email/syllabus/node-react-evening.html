			Hi {{name}},<br /><br />

			Also, if you would like to preview a class, we run evening classes Monday - Thursday from 6pm to 9pm. Depending on the day, these classes cover Node, iOS and React.  You are welcome to sit in a session to get a feel for our teaching style, pace and group dynamic. Thanks and let me know if you have any questions.
