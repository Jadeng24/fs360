				general: [
					{question:'Why React, React Native & Node?', answer:'Simply put, React with Node is the most demanded tech stack today among startups and leading tech companies like Facebook and AirBnB. React with Node brings powerful component-based architecture to the web, all under a single language. According to  StackOverlow’s <a target="_blank" href="http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016">2016 Developer Survey</a>, React is the Top Trending Tech by a large margin. Ruby on Rails is not even in the <a target="_blank" href="http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#technology-top-paying-tech">Top Paying Tech</a> list, yet React is. The data speaks for itself. Check out our <a href="https://www.velocity360.io/post/starting-out-today/">blog post</a>.'},
					{question:'How much programming experience do I need?', answer:'There is no minimum experience required. We do not admit based on prior knowledge. but rather ability to learn in a fast-paced environment. For example, we’d gladly admit a student who recently began learning Python but shows a propensity for development over someone who learned Java 5+ years ago but struggles with learning anything new.'},
					{question:'Are instructors available beyond course hours?', answer:'Yes - our instructors hold weekly office hours to address any bugs. Due to the small and intimate class sizes instructors will often make themselves available before or after a session to help students with any material.'},
					{question:'Cancellation Policy', answer:'Your deposit is refundable until the course begins. Before the halfway point, 50% tuition (minus your deposit) is refundable. No refunds are permitted beyond the halfway point of the course.'},
					{question:'What is a typical class size?', answer:'A typical class size is 7. Due to space limitations, no class will exceed 10 people. Our intimate classes enable instructors to give each student ample attention and assistance.'},
					{question:'Mac or PC?', answer:'Either one is acceptable, however a Mac will be easier and is preferred. Instructors will use a Mac.'},
					{question:'What is the teaching style?', answer:'We teach practical coding, not algorithms and theory. We do NOT show videos, give long lectures or require a vocab list.'},
					{question:'Will I have a project to show by the course’s end?', answer:'Yes, and likely more than one. We encourage you to post them to your Github.'}
